# tasks.md -- pm-zero v9.4 Execution Ledger

## Goal Binding
- Vision source: docs/vision.md
- Active goal: Maintain Task Plant under pm-zero v9.4 with product code changes tracked as explicit tasks.
- Planning owner: Codex CLI
- Implementation owner: Codex CLI
- Review owner: Codex CLI self-audit; cross-vendor review required only for trigger work.

## Status Vocabulary
- proposed: idea exists, not ready
- ready: owner, dependencies, write scope, acceptance, verification, and expected evidence are clear
- doing: one owner is actively working
- blocked: needs decision, dependency, credential, environment, or human action
- review: implementation complete, review pending
- done: accepted by reviewer
- verified: evidence recorded

## Parallelization Rules
- Coordinator owns tasks.md.
- Worker agents own only their assigned Write Scope.
- Parallel implementation requires disjoint Write Scopes or isolated worktrees.
- If two tasks need the same file, serialize them.
- Subagents return reports; coordinator updates tasks.md.

## Tasks
| ID | Status | Owner | Depends On | Write Scope | Acceptance | Verification | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T001 | verified | Codex CLI | none | Legacy pm-zero metadata and project docs | Repository had the earlier task ledger, repo map, scope lock rules, aligned commands, and pnpm-only lockfile policy | git diff --check; pnpm lint; pnpm typecheck; pnpm test; pnpm build; pnpm verify | all passed on 2026-05-15 |
| T002 | ready | Codex CLI | T001 | Existing implementation files for active product work only | Continue Task Plant Phase 1-7 using docs/implementation-plan.md with disjoint write scope per task | pnpm lint; pnpm typecheck; pnpm build; related tests; browser smoke for UI | pending |
| T003 | verified | Codex CLI | T001 | src/app/plant/page.tsx, src/components/navigation/bottom-nav.tsx, src/components/plant/, src/hooks/use-plant.ts, src/lib/domain/plant.ts, tests/lib/domain/plant.test.mjs, docs/decisions.md, docs/repo-map.md, docs/state.md, tasks.md | Plant tab is visible on app screens, `/plant` renders the monthly plant view, and domain tests prevent blank plant state regressions | pnpm lint; pnpm typecheck; pnpm test; pnpm build; pnpm verify; browser smoke | all passed on 2026-05-15; smoke confirmed `/`, `/plant`, `/all` show 3-tab nav and `/plant` shows バラ |
| T004 | verified | Codex CLI | T003 | src/lib/domain/plant.ts, src/hooks/use-plant.ts, src/lib/taskDb.ts, src/hooks/use-home-screen.ts, src/components/all/all-screen.tsx, src/components/navigation/bottom-nav.tsx, src/components/home/home-screen.tsx, src/components/plant/plant-screen.tsx, tests/lib/domain/plant.test.mjs, docs/decisions.md, docs/state.md, tasks.md | Review指摘のNB-1〜NB-4を解消し、週境界・植物同期・採番重複の再発を防止する | pnpm lint; pnpm typecheck; pnpm test; pnpm build; pnpm verify | all passed on 2026-05-15; week-start tests added; plantState sync added for / and /all update paths |
| T005 | verified | Codex CLI | none | AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, HANDOFF-JA.md, tasks.md, docs/state.md, docs/repo-map.md, docs/decisions.md, scripts/setup.mjs, scripts/verify.mjs, .claude/settings.json, .gitignore | pm-zero v9.4 source-of-truth files are current, old project-local hook/MCP/Codex scaffolds are removed unless justified, and product code is untouched | git diff --check; pnpm verify | 2026-05-17: node scripts/verify.mjs passed; git diff --check passed before commit. |

## Execution Pointer
Current active task, executor, write lock, and latest verification live in docs/state.md.

## Blockers
| ID | Task | Blocker | Needed decision | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Review Notes
| Task | Reviewer | Result | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|
| T001 | Codex CLI self-audit | pass | Cross-vendor review not triggered; changes are OS docs/scripts and package scripts only. |
